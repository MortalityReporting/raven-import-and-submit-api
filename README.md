# Raven-Import-API

## Introduction

The **Raven-Import-API** is a backend API service designed for the Raven Mortality Case Management System. It integrates tightly with a FHIR server and its data source. It is recommended to deploy Raven-Import-API alongside the [raven-fhir-server](https://github.com/MortalityReporting/raven-fhir-server), which serves as the primary data source.

### Key Features
- **Import Service**: Converts XLSX or CSV data into MDI-FHIR resources and submits them to a raven-fhir-server.
- **Export Service**: **Depreciated** Retrieves and packages case data from the raven-fhir-server and submits it to state registrars in the standardized VRDR format.

## Requirements And Installation

Requirements for installation are:
* [Java-jdk version 10 or higher](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
* [The build tool maven](http://maven.apache.org/)
* A version of the MDI_java library. The correct version of the library is contained as a git submodule in this repository.

### Installation

1. **Install MDI Java Library**

Navigate to MDI_javalib within the project directory and run:

```bash
mvn install
```

2. **Package the Main Project**
 
Move to the project root directory and build the WAR package:

```bash
mvn package
```

3. **Run Locally**

Run the application with:
    
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Dockerfile alternative

You can also use the provided Dockerfile for a containerized setup.

* [Docker installed locally](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

1. **Build the container**

```bash
docker build -t raven-import-api .
```

2. **Run the container**

```bash
docker run -p 80:80 raven-import-api
```


## Configuration

All configuration for the project can be found in ```src/main/resources/application.properties```. All current configurable properties are set to read environment variables and are in the form ```some.key.path=${ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_HERE}```. It is recommended to replace these environment variables with hard-coded values to reflect your environment.

* ```fhircms.url``` A full url definition to the fhir base of the current raven-fhir-server
* ```fhircms.basicAuth.username``` If [basic authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/basic-authentication/) is used to access raven-fhir-server, specify the username to authenticate with.
* ```fhircms.basicAuth.password``` If [basic authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/basic-authentication/) is used to access raven-fhir-server, specify the password to authenticate with.
* ```fhircms.submit=true```. Specifies whether to use [fhir's batch submission](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html#transaction) when importing into the system. Should not be changed unless you know what you're doing.
* ```canary.url=${CANARY_URL}```. **DEPRECIATED** Specifies a [canary instance](https://github.com/nightingaleproject/canary/) url for validating VRDR records before exporting records from the cms. If left blank, the VRDR records won't be validated from the canary tool, and is unnecessary if a canary instance is unavailable for use.
* ```submission.sources.sourceurl[x]```  **DEPRECIATED** Specifies a url source to export towards in the "export-all" workflow. The service will export VRDR records to each url specified. Can be omitted if the export-targeted mode is used instead (more on that in the exporting section)
* ```submission.sources.mode[x]```  **DEPRECIATED** Specifies a workflow submission mode to export towards in the "export-all" workflow. The currently supported modes are "axiell", "nightingale", and "vitalcheck", which are 3 different state registrar vendors with different workflows for exporting. As more vendors become available, more modes will be added to the system. Can be omitted if the export-targeted mode is used instead (more on that in the exporting section)

## Importing Tool
The web-based importing tool is accessible from the root URL of the deployed application. Use the file selector to upload a CSV or XLSX file of case data. The tool converts the data to FHIR resources, submits them to the raven-fhir-server, and provides a report of imported cases, including name, age, and status.

The reference files for xlsx and csv import are available as files within the top level of the project.
```
MDI-To-EDRS-Template.csv
MDI-To-EDRS-Template.xlsx
Tox-To-MDI-Template.xlsx
```

##Exporting Tool

**DEPRECIATED**

To use the exporting tool, you must make a REST request to the ```/submitEDRS``` endpoint
### /submitEDRS parameters

* `endpointURL`: A url definition of a receiving EDRS system
* `endpointMode`: A workflow mode of submitting, based on receiving system. 3 systems are supported right now: "Nightingale", "Axiell", and "Vitalcheck".
* `systemIdentifier`: A patient identifier system within the fhir system for the patient to be submitted. Works with `codeIdentifier` to define a full patient identifier.
* `codeIdentifier`: A patient identifier code within the fhir system for the patient to be submitted. Works with `systemIdentifier` to define a full patient identifier.

If no parameters are supplied then the configuration endpoints are used instead, as discussed in the configuration section
